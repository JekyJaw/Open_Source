# Gladius

Gladius is a game engine, written entirely in JavaScript, and designed to run in the browser. We leverage existing web technologies whenever possible and where gaps exist in support for games, we develop new solutions.

## Version

Gladius follows the Semantic Versioning Specification. See http://semver.org for full details.

## Reporting Issues

Please report issues through the github project. Questions and discussions happen in #paladin on irc.mozilla.org, and on the paladin-dev mailing list at https://groups.google.com/group/paladin-dev.

## Getting Started

Make sure to clone all submodules. This can be done using 'make submodule'.

## Build and Test

No building is needed for development workflows. To build the engine for distribution, run make in the top-level
project directory. The build process produces a javascript file containing the entire engine and its dependencies
and also a minified version of that file.

Run unit tests by opening test/ directory in a web browser. Tests run automatically and failures are marked in red.
