# Paladin

Paladin is Mozilla's movement to provide open source gaming technology for the web.

## Version Number

Paladin follows the Semantic Versioning Specification. See http://semver.org for full details.

## Reporting Issues

## Build and Test

No building is needed for development workflows. To build the engine for distribution, run make in the top-level
project directory. The build process produces a javascript file containing the entire engine and its dependencies
and also a minified version of that file.

Run unit tests by opening test/ directory in a web browser. Tests run automatically and failures are marked in red.
